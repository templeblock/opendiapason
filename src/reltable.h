/* Creates a release alignment table for aligning a release with an

 *   particular number of samples: N. i.e.
 *
 *   for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
 *     envelope_buf[i] = 0.0;

 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * - correlation_buf is the sum of the correlations (one for each channel) of
 *   N samples of the release segment with the input signal. i.e.
 *
 *   for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
 *     correlation_buf[i] = 0.0;
 *     for (ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) {

 *         correlation_buf[i] += attack_sustain[ch][i + n] * release[ch][i + n];
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * - rel_power is the sum of the powers of the release over N samples (over all
 *   channels). i.e.
 *
 *   rel_power = 0.0;
 *   for (ch = 0; ch < num_channels; ch++) {
 *     for (n = 0; n < N; n++) {
 *       rel_power += release[ch][n] * release[ch][n];
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * - buf_len is the number of valid data points in envelope_buf and
 *   correlation_buf.
 *
 * - period is the period in samples of the audio data.
 *
 * - debug_prefix is a file-name or path which will be used as a prefix to
 *   debug dump files. They will all begin with "reltable". If this is NULL,
 *   no debug files will be dumped. */
