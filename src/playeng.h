/* Playback engine instances can be in one of three states:
 *
 *   1) inactive - this is an instance which can be reserved by the caller and
 *      inserted into the active list via an engine instruction.
 *   2) active - the instance is now owned by the audio thread and is being
 *      played back the engine.
 *   3) zombie - the instance is still owned by the audio thread, but is no
 *      longer being played. This generally happens when an active instance
 *      has completed playback. This state exists to permit control threads to
 *      still send instructions to state after playback (this is not useful,
 *      but is necessary because of threading).
 *
 * Instances always start in the inactive state, then enter the active state
 * then enter the zombie state, and the cycle continues. */

/* Engine synchronisation primitives.
 *
 * These (if used correctly), have no effect on the playback engine if it is
 * being operated within a single thread. They are useful for guaranteeing
 * synchronisation for certain aspects of playback when playeng_process() is
 * being called from a different thread to playeng_insert() or
 * playeng_signal_instance(). It is worth mentioning at this point that
 * playeng_process() never blocks; primarily, this means that these
 * synchronisation mechanisms are useful for guaranteeing that things happen
 * at the "same time", but there is no guarantee made for when they actually
 * happen. This is deemed acceptable as the calling thread should not be
 * "hammering" playeng_insert() all the time.
 *
 * playeng_push_block_insertion() and
 * playeng_pop_block_insertion() are related to sample insertion
 *
 * playeng_signal_unblock() and
 * playeng_signal_block() are related to signalling information
 *
 * playeng_push_block_insertion() can be thought of as incrementing a number
 * which when non-zero blocks samples in the "wait" state (see
 * playeng_insert()) from being moved into the active state where they will
 * be played/have callbacks made. playeng_pop_block_insertion() decrements
 * the number. These functions have no influence over already active samples.
 *
 * playeng_signal_block() and playeng_signal_unblock() impact samples
 * already in the active state. playeng_signal_block() is used to temporarily
 * provide a mask of signals to ignore i.e. if they are set in the sample,
 * they will not trigger a callback, but the state will also not be cleared.
 * This permits many different sample instances to be signalled, but the
 * signal will only be processed once it has been unblocked by the engine.
 * The format of the mask for block is 1s indicate signals to block.
 * The format of the mask for unblock is 1s indicate signals to unblock. */
