/* How to use this API:
 *
 *   1) Initialize an fftset object. This will hold all the memory for the
 *      different DFT coefficients.
 *   2) Create an fft pass object. This will describe a particular DFT (or
 *      variety on a DFT) matrix depending on the constructor used. Currently
 *      there is only one constructor:
 *        - fastconv_get_real_conv() which creates a real input, complex
 *          output modulation. The frequency vector is shifted by 0.5.
 *          Convolution still works on the output.
 *   3) Depending on whether you are using this DFT for convolution or ordered
 *      analysis:
 *        - Convolution: use fastconv_execute_fwd() to create the frequency
 *          domain filter kernel. Then use calls to fastconv_execute_conv() to
 *          perform convolution operations.
 *        - Analysis (output bins required to be in a particular order): use
 *          fastconv_execute_fwd_reord() and fastconv_execute_rev_reord() to
 *          perform the forward/inverse modulations respectively. */
